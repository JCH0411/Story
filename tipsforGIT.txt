how to set up git and github
---------locale-----------------------------------------
1. in terminal underfile or directory do all the commands
2. git init ( git status shows uncommited files)
3. git add "then filename to add to staging"   ( or do git add . to add more than one file)
4. git commit -m "savePointName"
5. the commit is now saved locally
6. git log     shows all commits
7. git status will show un commited changes
8. git diff "fileName"  (shows the difference between a file with unsaved changes)
9. git checkout "fileName" will revert back to the last version that was commited 

how to set up remote to github and committing
------------------Remote----------------------------------
1. under the same directory locally can be commited remotely to git hub (this is regarding the same file above so make sure your in the same directory )
2. go  to git hub and create a new repository and get the web link after creating repository
3. then use the lines of code given on the same screen as the link when creating the github repository 
4. in terminal do under the same locally directory (file) ->  git remote add origin "then the web link"
5. So now you can push using the remote name origin -->> git push -u origin master
6. so first do git add "filename" then git push -u origin master

---------------------to ignore and hide files---------------------------------
1. .ds_store saves settings and user profiles and its a hidden file
2. create hidden file first .gitignore
3. then create the git init to create git for dir(so your making a git for the folder) -> git init
4. then add your files in the folder using git add (name of file or . for all) -->> so 
5. but if you dont want to commit some files before commit you need to add those files names to the gitignore file
6. use -->>(git rm --cashed -r .)----- to remove all files from staging area so you can add which ever to gitignore
7. to add certain files to be ignored--->> add the files names to the gitignore file for the files you want to ignore and save
8. in your gitignore file (*.txt will ignore all the files with a txt file)
----------------cloning--------------------------------------------------------
1.in github just get the link for the project under cloning
2. then in hyper terminal do git clone then th url so -->> git clone https://github.com/austinzheng/swift-2048.git
creates dir in the dir you were in when cloning
--------------------branching and merging--------------------------------------
1. can create experimental branches by branching used for testing new units 
2. under the directory you want to branch do -->> git branch "name of new branch"
3. git branch---- shows all the branches you have with * next to the one using 
4. switch to another branch by using -->> git checkout "branch-name" 
5. to merge branches go back to master branch then use -->> git merge "name of branch"
6. the branch you merged still exist
7. you can then do -->> git push origin master -u to push to github
8. you can also branch inside github itself
-----------forking and pulling (collaberation)--------------------------------
1. forking means you own a copy so you can do what you want to the code
2. in github you can fork someones project. this is a copy
3. once forked and in another account you can add to it. once the forked account makes changes they show up in original owners changes
4. the new owner can then make a pull request for the old owner to approve it and add it to the original project
